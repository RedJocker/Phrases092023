<h2>Description </h2>

<p>To see the phrases that you have added to the application, you need to print them somewhere on the screen. In this stage, you need to set up the <code>RecyclerView</code> so that it shows the list of the phrases on your activity screen.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Create an XML layout for your <code>RecyclerView</code> items. The view should contain a <code>TextView</code> with the phrase <em>(</em>ID:<em> </em><code>phraseTextView</code><em>)</em> and a <code>Delete</code> <code>TextView</code> to remove it <em>(</em>ID:<em> </em><code>deleteTextView</code><em>)</em>. You are free to design the app however you want, but don't change the IDs of the two <code>Views</code>;</li>
	<li>Create an adapter for your <code>RecyclerView</code>. The adapter should show the list with your predefined phrases. Set an <code>OnClickListener</code> for the <code>Delete</code> <code>TextView</code> that will remove the item. In this stage, we don't need you to save user's actions in any way, so it's okay if you restart the app, but the deleted phrases are back;</li>
	<li>Show at least three phrases on the screen.</li>
</ol>
